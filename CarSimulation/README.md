	"The automobiles project"
	
	The entire aim of it is to create a reproduction of some area in the town. There is a certain number of cars, all of them
are autopiloted and controlled by the main kernel. Not any car knows the location of the other cars. We take one car and
start a ride. It rides randomly, according to all the rules of driving regulations. The computer counts its speed 
and makes it turn or to stop, knowing the position of other cars, crossings, traffic lights and so on. All this actions we 
can observe right on the interactive screen.
	All in all, the main aims:
	*the existence of the main system, which controls the traffic
	*abidence to driving regulations
	*choose certain car, others ride randomly
